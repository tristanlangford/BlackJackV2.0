# About

Done pre Makers Academy course. Built on a precourse exercise of creating a very basic BlackJack game.

started with basic functions such as dealing the cards, capturing totals, end game scenrions. Early versions of the code were messy and unrefracted,
learnt the importance of planning the structure of your code to align with your programme methodology to make it easier when adding features.
